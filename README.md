Developer Notes

When installing the xbmcswift environment as described at http://xbmcswift2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html,
 * the virtualenv wrapper installation is done by 'sudo pip install virtualenvwrapper'
 * before building the virtual environment, you need to source the virtualenvwrapper.sh (usually found at /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh)

To deploy a new version,
 * update the version in the plugin addon.xml file
 * update the version in the repository addon.xml file
 * generate new version : run 'python ./repo_prep.py' from the root directory.
